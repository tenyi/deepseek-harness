# 會話投影

[English](session-projection.md) | 中文

會話投影 seam 是一項[能力 seam](../capability-seams.zh.md)：領域 host 插件經由它向客戶端載體供給按會話的日志派生狀態的當前全量值；三方分別是 Service Definition 與注冊表（[dsh-session-projection](../../packages/session/session-projection)，`ctx.sessionProjections`）、領域貢獻方（每個領域注冊一個純單元）與載體（[dsh-session-controller](../../packages/api/session-controller) 的歷史尾頁與 `session/projection` 推送幀）。它是一項可選能力，不屬于 agent loop（智能體循環）主干。框架負責驅動，領域負責計算：注冊表只訂閱一次 `session/event`，并把每個已提交事件折疊進每個單元；領域不持有任何訂閱，客戶端也從不折疊領域事件——它們收到的是成品值。設計權威：[session-projection RFC](../../.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-07-27-session-projection-and-command-log.zh.md)；驅動、緩存與變更流約定：[包 README](../../packages/session/session-projection/README.zh.md)。

## 投影單元

`SessionProjectionStateMap` 是 host 側折疊狀態的 merge-extensible 類型表，`SessionProjectionMap` 則繼續表示客戶端可見的全量值。領域為每個狀態 key 貢獻一個 `ProjectionDefinition`；`wire` 塊使該 key 對客戶端可見，渲染歸 slot 體系管，永遠不歸本層：

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One domain's state-driven computation unit: a pure synchronous fold plus
 * declarations and an optional client view — never an opaque getter. The framework drives
 * `apply` on every committed session event; the domain holds no
 * subscriptions and owns only the computation. All functions MUST be
 * synchronous (an async unit would tear the carriers' consistency cut), and
 * `state` MUST be plain JSON (the persisted-cache precondition).
 */
interface ProjectionDefinition<
  K extends keyof SessionProjectionStateMap,
  S extends SessionProjectionStateMap[K] = SessionProjectionStateMap[K],
> {
  /** The projection key this unit owns (its `SessionProjectionStateMap` entry). */
  key: K
  /** Validates persisted state before it seeds a fold. */
  stateSchema: ZodType<S>
  /**
   * State for the empty log and its immutable Session metadata.
   * @param header - immutable metadata for the Session being projected.
   * @param inheritedEventCount - exact fork-inherited prefix length.
   * @returns the initial state.
   */
  init(header: SessionHeader, inheritedEventCount: SessionLogOffset): NoInfer<S>
  /**
   * Pure transition: previous state + one committed event → next state. A
   * unit uninterested in an event MUST return the same state reference — an
   * unchanged reference (`Object.is`) produces zero downstream work.
   * @param state - the state covering all prior events.
   * @param event - the next committed session event.
   * @returns the next state (same reference when the event is not the unit's).
   */
  apply(state: NoInfer<S>, event: SessionEvent): NoInfer<S>
  /** Client view. Omit for host-only units. */
  wire?: K extends keyof SessionProjectionMap ? {
    /** Validates the wire payload before it leaves the host. */
    viewSchema: ZodType<SessionProjectionMap[K]>
    /**
     * State → wire payload (the read-side projection). The live drive keeps
     * the two latest raw results and compares them with `Object.is`; an
     * object-valued view must reuse its reference to suppress publication
     * across internal-only state changes.
     * @param state - the current state.
     * @returns the whole current value for this unit's key.
     */
    view(state: NoInfer<S>): SessionProjectionMap[K]
  } : never
  /**
   * Persisted-cache invalidation version: bump whenever the serialized state fields or the
   * fold semantics change, so persisted `(sessionId, key, ver, seq, val)`
   * rows from an older unit are discarded instead of being forward-applied
   * into garbage. Non-negative integer.
   */
  stateVersion: number
}
```

全量值事件規則是承重結構：攜帶狀態的日志事件攜帶的是變更后的完整狀態，絕不是裸增量——這讓每次狀態轉移始終足夠廉價，也讓每個被供給的值自描述（對消費方即 last-wins）。

## 快照與變更流

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One consistent read cut over every registered client-visible unit for one session.
 * `asOfSeq` is the shared watermark — the seq of the last event every value
 * reflects (`-1` for an empty log).
 */
interface ProjectionSnapshot {
  /** Seq of the last event the values reflect; -1 for an empty log. */
  asOfSeq: SessionSeqCursor
  /** Whole current client value per registered key. */
  values: Partial<SessionProjectionMap>
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Change-feed listener: one unit's raw `view` result changed by `Object.is`
 * for one session. `value` is the schema-validated output; `seq` is the
 * unit's watermark at emission (the seq of the event that caused the change).
 */
type ProjectionChangeListener = (
  session: Session,
  key: Extract<keyof SessionProjectionMap, string>,
  value: unknown,
  seq: SessionSeq,
) => void
```

`snapshot(session)` 完全同步：載體在切出頁面切片的同一 tick 內讀取它，因此 `asOfSeq` 使兩次讀取使用同一個序號。它只返回客戶端視圖，并在返回前通過各單元的 `viewSchema` 校驗。`stateOf(session, key)` 可在不計算無關視圖的情況下讀取一份實時 host 狀態；調用方不得修改這一借用引用。state 引用變化時，注冊表計算并緩存一次原始 view；只有該結果通過 `Object.is` 判定為變化時才觸發變更流，對象 view 若要在僅內部 state 變化時抑制發布就必須保留引用。

## 注冊表：`ctx.sessionProjections`

`SessionProjectionRegistry`（[簽名](#ctxsessionprojections--sessionprojectionregistry)）擁有驅動權：一份 `session/event` 訂閱、對每個已注冊單元即時調用 `apply`，以及每會話每單元的水位線（watermark）cell。cell 惰性構建：在事件流過之后才注冊的單元，或比注冊表更早的會話，都在首次觸達（事件或讀取）時從 `init` 出發在內存日志上折疊。注冊是一個 effect，其 disposer 隨調用方 fiber 走：領域插件卸載后，其 key（連同緩存的 cell）從后續驅動與快照中消失，客戶端將其讀作能力缺失；key 以不同 `stateVersion` 重復時直接 throw，同版本注冊方則共享一個單元并被計數。領域插件在 `ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'], …)` 下注冊，因此不帶注冊表的 headless 組裝完全不受影響。

### `ctx.sessionProjectionCache` — `SessionProjectionCache`

The persisted projection cache service. Opens the `session_projcache` domain at init, checkpoints live sessions on a throttled write-behind (count/interval triggers from Config) plus three mandatory points — session creation, `turn/end`, and session disposal (the live-to-cold moment) — and serves the cached rows for a session header. Every durable write is fail-soft: failures log a warning and the cache self-heals on the next write.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * The zero-I/O listing read: whole values viewed straight from the stored
 * rows (version-matching keys only), each cut carried with its watermark so
 * a client value store can seed under its higher-seq-wins rule — as stale
 * as the last durable checkpoint but never wrong, and never from an
 * unrelated log (the caller's header is the identity witness). Fresher
 * paths (the history tail baseline) supersede these values whenever a
 * session is actually opened.
 * @param meta - the listed session's header (identity witness; no log read).
 * @param inheritedEventCount - exact inherited prefix length that completes
 * the checkpoint identity.
 * @param keys - optional projection keys required by the caller's audience.
 * @returns the cut (`asOfSeq` = lowest served-row watermark), or
 *   `undefined` when no usable row exists for this lifecycle.
 */
cachedSnapshot( meta: SessionHeader, inheritedEventCount: SessionLogOffset, keys?: readonly Extract<keyof SessionProjectionMap, string>[], ): ProjectionSnapshot | undefined

/**
 * Read only a predecessor checkpoint's title as a zero-I/O listing hint.
 *
 * The authoritative Session header supplies the lifecycle identity. A cache
 * checkpoint can lag that log but cannot lead it because writes flush the
 * log first, so a matching predecessor title is a genuine (possibly stale)
 * fact from this Session. The registry still requires the current title
 * projection's row version and schema. No other predecessor projection is
 * exposed: format normalization can change their current meaning, and the
 * strict {@link cachedSnapshot} / hydration paths continue to reject them.
 * @param meta - authoritative listed Session header.
 * @param inheritedEventCount - exact inherited cut completing the lifecycle identity.
 * @returns a title-only checkpoint view with `asOfSeq: -1`, or `undefined`
 *   when the record is current, newer, unrelated, missing, or incompatible
 *   with the title unit. The sentinel avoids reusing a sequence that a
 *   cardinality-changing Session migration may have remapped.
 */

### `ctx.sessionProjections` — `SessionProjectionRegistry`

`ctx.sessionProjections`: the projection unit table and its drive. The service subscribes to `session/event` once; every committed event passes every registered unit's `apply` (eager drive). A changed state reference computes the next client view; the change feed is notified only when its raw result changes by `Object.is`. Cells build lazily — a unit registered after events flowed, or a session older than the registry, folds `init` over the in-memory log on first touch (event or read). Registration is an effect (disposer rides the calling fiber): an unloaded domain plugin's key disappears from snapshots and clients read it as capability absence. A host reader either declares `sessionProjections` in its plugin `inject` or fails explicitly when the registry or required key is absent. Contributors may preserve optional registration through `ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'], ...)`. Registrants sharing a key share one unit and are counted: the same tool package mounted in N agent presets registers N times, and the key survives until the last one unloads.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register one domain's unit. The registration is an effect on the calling
 * context's fiber: disposing the fiber (or calling the returned disposer)
 * removes the key — and the unit's cached cells — from subsequent drives
 * and snapshots.

 * @returns the exact disposer that unregisters this unit.
